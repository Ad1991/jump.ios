\subsection{Detailed Description}
The JSON writer class. Objective-\/C types are mapped to JSON types in the following way:

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item NSNull -\/$>$ Null \item NSString -\/$>$ String \item NSArray -\/$>$ Array \item NSDictionary -\/$>$ Object \item NSNumber (-\/initWithBool:) -\/$>$ Boolean \item NSNumber -\/$>$ Number\end{DoxyItemize}
In JSON the keys of an object must be strings. NSDictionary keys need not be, but attempting to convert an NSDictionary with non-\/string keys into JSON will throw an exception.

NSNumber instances created with the +initWithBool: method are converted into the JSON boolean \char`\"{}true\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}false\char`\"{} values, and vice versa. Any other NSNumber instances are converted to a JSON number the way you would expect. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
/Users/lillialexis/iPhone/engage.iphone/JREngage/JSON\_\-moved\_\-to\_\-make\_\-sym\_\-link/SBJsonWriter.h\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
