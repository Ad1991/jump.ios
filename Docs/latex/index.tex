\href{http://rpxnow.com/docs/iphone_v2}{\tt Janrain Engage for iPhone} makes it easy to include third party authentication and social publishing in your iPhone app. This Objective-\/C library includes the same key features as our web version. With a few lines of code, you can authenticate your users with their accounts on Google, Yahoo!, Facebook, etc., and they can immediately publish their activities to multiple social networks, including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, MySpace and Yahoo, through one simple interface.

Before you begin, you need to have created a \href{https://rpxnow.com/signup_createapp_plus}{\tt Janrain Engage application}, which you can do on \href{http://rpxnow.com}{\tt http://rpxnow.com}
