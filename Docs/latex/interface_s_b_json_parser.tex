\subsection{Detailed Description}
The JSON parser class. JSON is mapped to Objective-\/C types in the following way:

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Null -\/$>$ NSNull \item String -\/$>$ NSMutableString \item Array -\/$>$ NSMutableArray \item Object -\/$>$ NSMutableDictionary \item Boolean -\/$>$ NSNumber (initialised with -\/initWithBool:) \item Number -\/$>$ NSDecimalNumber\end{DoxyItemize}
Since Objective-\/C doesn't have a dedicated class for boolean values, these turns into NSNumber instances. These are initialised with the -\/initWithBool: method, and round-\/trip back to JSON properly. (They won't silently suddenly become 0 or 1; they'll be represented as 'true' and 'false' again.)

JSON numbers turn into NSDecimalNumber instances, as we can thus avoid any loss of precision. (JSON allows ridiculously large numbers.) 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
/Users/lillialexis/iPhone/engage.iphone/JREngage/JSON\_\-moved\_\-to\_\-make\_\-sym\_\-link/SBJsonParser.h\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
