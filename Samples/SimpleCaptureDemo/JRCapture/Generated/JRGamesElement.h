/**
 * Use this method to determine if the object or element needs to be updated remotely.
 * That is, if there are local changes to any of the object/elements's properties or 
 * sub-objects, then this object will need to be updated on Capture. You can update
 * an object on Capture by using the method updateOnCaptureForDelegate:context:().
 *
 * @return
 * \c YES if this object or any of it's sub-objects have any properties that have changed
 * locally. This does not include properties that are arrays, if any, or the elements contained 
 * within the arrays. \c NO if no non-array properties or sub-objects have changed locally.
 *
 * @warning
 * This object, or one of its ancestors, is an element of a plural. If any elements of the plural have changed,
 * (added or removed) the array must be replaced on Capture before the elements or their sub-objects can be
 * updated. Please use the appropriate <code>replace&lt;<em>ArrayName</em>&gt;ArrayOnCaptureForDelegate:context:</code>
 * method first. Even if JRCaptureObject#needsUpdate returns \c YES, this object cannot be updated on Capture unless
 * JRCaptureObject#canBeUpdatedOnCapture also returns \c YES.
 *
 * @par
 * This method recursively checks all of the sub-objects of JRGamesElement
 * but does not check any of the arrays of the JRGamesElement or the arrays' elements:
 *   - JRGamesElement#opponents, JROpponentsElement
 * .
 * @par
 * If you have added or removed any elements from the arrays, you must call the following methods
 * to update the array on Capture: replaceOpponentsArrayOnCaptureForDelegate:context:()
 *
 * @par
 * Otherwise, if the array elements' JRCaptureObject#canBeUpdatedOnCapture and JRCaptureObject#needsUpdate returns \c YES, you can update
 * the elements by calling updateOnCaptureForDelegate:context:().
