We use <a href=%34/products/engage%34>Janrain Engage</a> to allow for third-party logins, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc. When we first built our product, <a href=%34http://tal.ki/%34 target=%34_blank%34>Tal.ki Embeddable Forums</a>, we made the&nbsp;conscious&nbsp;decision to not build our own user login system, we wanted to go the third-party route, this had two advantages:</p> <ol> <li>Less development time to get to market</li> <li>A seamless experience for forums embedded across thousands of sites, no need to signup and create a new profile each time, just hop in and join the conversation.</li> </ol> <p>At first, we directly integrated with the third-party providers and provided support for Facebook, Google, and Twitter. But <strong>we quickly learned that managing these providers required ongoing work to follow their ever-changing APIs</strong> (I&#39;m looking at you Facebook). For a startup, that was taking significant resources. A colleague had mentioned <a href=%34http://www.janrain.com%34>Janrain</a>. I was familiar with the company from their very early work &amp; contributions in the OpenID space. After reading up on their documentation, we really liked the idea of supporting only *one* API and letting Janrain handle the rest, from evolving APIs to adding new <a href=%34/solutions/supported-networks%34>providers</a>. The decision was clear for us and we made the switch rapidly.</p> <p>We quickly became impressed with the <a href=%34/products/janrain-engage/features%34>features Janrain had to offer</a>, like login analytics, and a dashboard to select and edit login network preferences. The ability to track daily logins has proved useful. It allows us to know where to focus our attention for pushing updates to a person&#39;s activity stream. And because we support Single Sign-On (SSO), we can also track the logins of third-party companies we partner with and see how their daily activity is improving. Some of our partners include <a href=%34http://www.weebly.com/%34 target=%34_blank%34>Weebly</a>, <a href=%34http://www.bligoo.com/%34 target=%34_blank%34>Bligoo</a>, and <a href=%34http://www.yola.com/%34 target=%34_blank%34>Yola</a>.</p> <p>We&#39;re now supporting more logins than we had ever planned, and that is important, for instance, when the Facebook privacy issue hit the mainstream news, we saw Facebook logins drop, and a handful of other logins picked up, that we wouldn&#39;t have previously supported.</p> <p style=%34text-align: center; %34><img alt=%34%34 src=%34/sites/default/files/soccer.jpg%34 style=%34width: 280px; height: 167px; %34 /></p> <p>We have a second product line that doesn&#39;t have support for third-party logins, comparing the two services, I&#39;ve noticed a few interesting things:</p> <ul> <li>More visitors signing in.

				"plainText" :"Our partner, Vincent Lauria of Tal.ki, contributed this post for today: We've been running on the Janrain platform for over half a year now. We use Janrain Engage to allow for third-party logins, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc. When we first built our product, Tal.ki Embeddable Forums, we made the conscious decision to not build our own user login system, we wanted to go the third-party route, this had two advantages: Less development time to get to market A seamless experience for forums embedded across thousands of sites, no need to signup and create a new profile each time, just hop in and join the conversation. At first, we directly integrated with the third-party providers and provided support for Facebook, Google, and Twitter. But we quickly learned that managing these providers required ongoing work to follow their ever-changing APIs (I'm looking at you Facebook). For a startup, that was taking significant resources. A colleague had mentioned Janrain. I was familiar with the company from their very early work &amp; contributions in the OpenID space. After reading up on their documentation, we really liked the idea of supporting only *one* API and letting Janrain handle the rest, from evolving APIs to adding new providers. The decision was clear for us and we made the switch rapidly. We quickly became impressed with the features Janrain had to offer, like login analytics, and a dashboard to select and edit login network preferences. The ability to track daily logins has proved useful. It allows us to know where to focus our attention for pushing updates to a person's activity stream. And because we support Single Sign-On (SSO), we can also track the logins of third-party companies we partner with and see how their daily activity is improving. Some of our partners include Weebly, Bligoo, and Yola. We're now supporting more logins than we had ever planned, and that is important, for instance, when the Facebook privacy issue hit the mainstream news, we saw Facebook logins drop, and a handful of other logins picked up, that we wouldn't have previously supported. We have a second product line that doesn't have support for third-party logins, comparing the two services, I've noticed a few interesting things: More visitors signing in. When we switched to third-party logins with Janrain, we saw the number of visitors who login increase by over 40% ! Less time with our support team. Previously, we had over 30 people/day with login issues that needed to head to a support site. Now with Janrain, we have not had one support issue due to login, issues like forgotten passwords, incorrect emails, expired or conflicting cookies are ting of the past. We're continuing to integrate more of the Janrain product line into our services, and in the past few months, I've had a number of colleagues tell me they're doing the same.",

You catch the only bus from a small village that is headed toward the coast. The bus is crowded with locals and their luggage, but you coincidentally find yourself seated next to another expatriate like yourself. She&#39;s traveling in the same direction, but planning to head further South. The two of you hit it off and you soon find yourself lost in conversation. Hours later, you suddenly realize you&#39;re at your stop. The bus driver won&#39;t wait; he has a schedule to keep. You have to get off immediately, but you want to continue the conversation. You have a pen and nothing to write on but your arm. What&#39;s the one piece of information you ask for so you have any hope of getting back in touch?</p> <p> This was the thought experiment presented by <a href=%34http://www.crunchbase.com/person/blaine-cook%34 target=%34_blank%34>Blaine Cook</a> at the <a href=%34http://federatedsocialweb.net/wiki/Main_Page%34 target=%34_blank%34>Federated Social Web Summit</a> (FSWS) here in Portland. It&#39;s meant to illustrate a central theme that occupied much of the discussions at the summit: how do people identify each other and share information on the social web? If someone asks me for my contact information, do I give out my cell phone number, my personal email address or my work email address? How about my Twitter handle, or my employer&#39;s URL? Would I give out different information to a friend than to a colleague? Would the information vary if I was overseas rather than home here in Portland? The answers to these questions seem simple on the surface, but once you dig a little deeper, things become more complicated. The social web is imbued with varied and dynamic context and, as such, emerging methodologies, protocols and user experiences must adapt to a new set of challenges.</p> <p> The FSWS was facilitated by the technical team from <a href=%34http://Status.net%34 target=%34_blank%34>Status.net</a> to &quot;to coordinate the development of the federated social web.&quot; It was organized as a one day event preceding <a href=%34http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010%34 target=%34_blank%34>OSCON</a>, with invitations going out to a varied group of technical innovators at companies and academic institutions working on relevant protocols or architectures. I was curious to see how this rather broad agenda would manifest itself given the short amount of time we had together. The day opened with <a href=%34http://status.net/users/evan%34 target=%34_blank%34>Evan Prodromou</a>, Founder of <a href=%34http://Status.net%34 target=%34_blank%34>StatusNet</a>, sketching out a plan for the day. Each group gave a short presentation showing off their work in social federation. By lunch time I had seen presentations from StatusNet, Google, DiSo, Appleseed, Facebook, Diaspora, Six Apart, Mozilla, Microsoft, GNU Social, the Personal Data Store Project and @versionvega, among others. I presented a brief history of <a href=%34http://www.janrain.com%34>Janrain&#39;s</a> involvement in <a href=%34http://openid.net/%34 target=%34_blank%34>OpenID</a> and described some of the challenges we&#39;ve had to overcome in order to support a <a href=%34/solutions/supported-networks%34>large array of social media platforms</a>.</p> <p> The afternoon agenda for the summit was generated democratically, in real-time through the use of <a href=%34http://www.google.com/moderator/%34 target=%34_blank%34>Google Moderator</a>. Participants posted ideas for breakout sessions and we voted the topics up or down. Some common themes bubbled to the top and we eventually chose nine different tracks for detailed discussion. My interest in is protocols, so I attended three of the protocol-related tracks. The discussions centered around two major areas of pain: how to do end-user identifier discovery and how to avoid the problem of <a href=%34http://oauth.net/%34 target=%34_blank%34>OAuth</a> pre-registration. Both need to be solved before a truly open, federated social web can emerge.</p> <p> In the first session, Blaine Cook proposed a method for private <a href=%34http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/%34 target=%34_blank%34>PubSubHubbub</a> subscriptions using <a href=%34http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/wiki/WebFingerProtocol%34 target=%34_blank%34>WebFinger</a> for discovery and server dialbacks to verify the identity of the subscriber that involved an innovative use of the HTTP From: header. He proceeded to walk through an example of how person A could subscribe to person B&#39;s address book in an open, yet verifiable way, with person B being able to approve or deny access asynchronously. Following that presentation, <a href=%34http://www.google.com/profiles/bslatkin%34 target=%34_blank%34>Brett Slatkin</a> of Google proposed a more complicated version of the same use case, this time using OAuth.

				"plainText" :"Janrain software engineer Ivan Pulleyn attended the Federated Social Web Summit in Portland, Oregon last week.Below is a recap of Ivan's experience at the event: _____________ Imagine you're backpacking through the mountains in a distant country. You catch the only bus from a small village that is headed toward the coast. The bus is crowded with locals and their luggage, but you coincidentally find yourself seated next to another expatriate like yourself. She's traveling in the same direction, but planning to head further South. The two of you hit it off and you soon find yourself lost in conversation. Hours later, you suddenly realize you're at your stop. The bus driver won't wait; he has a schedule to keep. You have to get off immediately, but you want to continue the conversation. You have a pen and nothing to write on but your arm. What's the one piece of information you ask for so you have any hope of getting back in touch? This was the thought experiment presented by Blaine Cook at the Federated Social Web Summit (FSWS) here in Portland. It's meant to illustrate a central theme that occupied much of the discussions at the summit: how do people identify each other and share information on the social web? If someone asks me for my contact information, do I give out my cell phone number, my personal email address or my work email address? How about my Twitter handle, or my employer's URL? Would I give out different information to a friend than to a colleague? Would the information vary if I was overseas rather than home here in Portland? The answers to these questions seem simple on the surface, but once you dig a little deeper, things become more complicated. The social web is imbued with varied and dynamic context and, as such, emerging methodologies, protocols and user experiences must adapt to a new set of challenges. The FSWS was facilitated by the technical team from Status.net to &quot;to coordinate the development of the federated social web.&quot; It was organized as a one day event preceding OSCON, with invitations going out to a varied group of technical innovators at companies and academic institutions working on relevant protocols or architectures. I was curious to see how this rather broad agenda would manifest itself given the short amount of time we had together. The day opened with Evan Prodromou, Founder of StatusNet, sketching out a plan for the day. Each group gave a short presentation showing off their work in social federation. By lunch time I had seen presentations from StatusNet, Google, DiSo, Appleseed, Facebook, Diaspora, Six Apart, Mozilla, Microsoft, GNU Social, the Personal Data Store Project and @versionvega, among others. I presented a brief history of Janrain's involvement in OpenID and described some of the challenges we've had to overcome in order to support a large array of social media platforms. The afternoon agenda for the summit was generated democratically, in real-time through the use of Google Moderator. Participants posted ideas for breakout sessions and we voted the topics up or down. Some common themes bubbled to the top and we eventually chose nine different tracks for detailed discussion. My interest in is protocols, so I attended three of the protocol-related tracks. The discussions centered around two major areas of pain: how to do end-user identifier discovery and how to avoid the problem of OAuth pre-registration. Both need to be solved before a truly open, federated social web can emerge. In the first session, Blaine Cook proposed a method for private PubSubHubbub subscriptions using WebFinger for discovery and server dialbacks to verify the identity of the subscriber that involved an innovative use of the HTTP From: header. He proceeded to walk through an example of how person A could subscribe to person B's address book in an open, yet verifiable way, with person B being able to approve or deny access asynchronously. Following that presentation, Brett Slatkin of Google proposed a more complicated version of the same use case, this time using OAuth. Martin Atkins, of Six Apart, presented a third protocol idea, this time where the end-user approves a domain for access rather than another user. This was followed by a presentation on distributed comments using Salmon Protocol by Joseph Smarr of Google. Other participants included Maxwell Salzberg of Diaspora, David Recordon of Facebook, Rob Dolin of Miscrosoft and Bear of XMPP fame. At the close of the day, we reconvened and Evan proposed a challenge to the group. Dave Recordon had recommended a simple social federation use case and we decided to call it the Social Web Acid Test, level 0 -- SWAT0 for short. The challenge is &quot;to have as many discrete pairs of implementations pass the test by September 30, 2010.&quot; SWAT0 is a simple use case that has been implemented many times by proprietary social networks: two users sharing and tagging photos. The real challenge is to build this in a truly open, federated manner. I strongly encourage those with interest in the technical aspects of the social web participate in this effort by joining the mailing list or even building independent implementations. As FSWS closed, we enjoyed a demo of Diaspora in action, followed by drinks and conversation at a local venue. I left feeling inspired to participate in this emergent collaboration. Now back to our thought experiment: As you watch the bus pull away, a cloud of dust settles onto the dirt road. The sun is beating down on you as you struggle with your overstuffed backpack. You look down at your arm. What's written there?

My name is Carl Howells. I&#39;m a software engineer who&#39;s been working at JanRain for a bit over six years now. In that time, I&#39;ve worked on a more projects than I can even remember.</div> <p> As far as things relevant to the current world go, I was a very early implementer of the original OpenID proposal. My work helped uncover some holes in the initial proposal, and I felt like I contributed some useful bits.</p> <p> As JanRain continued in that space, I helped with initial versions of the OpenID 2.0 specification, but I eventually moved into handling implementation of the spec, and left writing it to those with more experience writing formal specifications.</p> <p> In the time since, I&#39;ve worked on all of JanRain&#39;s OpenID-related products. I currently help maintain and develop all of them, with most of my time spent on RPX.</p> <p> A couple months ago, I was asked if I wanted to attend the 10th annual <a href=%34http://www.internetidentityworkshop.com/%34>Internet Identity Workshop</a> (IIW), as our more technical representative. I hadn&#39;t previously attended an IIW, and I didn&#39;t know what to expect. The idea was a bit scary, but I agreed. With some trepidation, I woke up exceedingly early (in engineer time) Monday morning, packed for the trip, drove to the airport, and soon found myself at IIW.</p> <p> After the intro speech, <span style=%34font-weight: bold;%34>Kaliya Hamlin </span>(<a href=%34http://www.identitywoman.net/%34>IdentityWoman</a>, the co-founder/facilitator of IIW, and one of the few present I had met before) explained the format. The short version is &quot;anyone can propose any topic for discussion, anyone can join any discussion they like.&quot; Topics were scheduled in different areas of the workshop space at the beginning of each day.</p> <p> I spent the day checking out various sessions. Some, like the in-depth discussion of <span style=%34font-weight: bold;%34>David Recordon</span>&#39;s <a href=%34http://openidconnect.com/%34>OpenID Connect</a> proposal, were discussions of technologies directly related to our business. Others were peripherally related to directions future products might take, like Alan Karp&#39;s discussion of <a href=%34http://iiw.idcommons.net/Voluntary_Oblivious_Compliance%34>Voluntary Oblivious Compliance</a>. Finally, there were a couple that turned out to have no real relation to anything JanRain&#39;s doing, but still fascinated me.</p> <p> At the close of the day, everyone retired to the dinner generously provided at an excellent Italian restaurant by several of the conference&#39;s sponsors. I spent a short time in a conversation with <a href=%34http://www.xmlgrrl.com/blog/welcome/%34>Eve Maler</a> and several others, the main topic being the seeming death of XML validation. I soon moved on to introduce myself to <a href=%34http://www.sakimura.org/en/%34>Nat Sakimura</a> and a gentleman whose name I&#39;ve forgotten from the Dutch government.</p> <p> We had a long discussion about OpenID, population sizes, and how pretty Oregon is. I had a great time getting to know people working in very distinct government environments. We discussed use cases each government had, and how they&#39;re building their solutions on top of OpenID. It was a great reminder that governments have very different requirements from commercial entities, and that they&#39;re active in getting their needs addressed as well.</p> <p> Soon dinner was served, and we retired to the hotel afterwards. Brian Kissel, CEO of JanRain, is an alumnus of Stanford. This lets him reserve rooms at the Stanford Guest House. It was a terrifically surreal experience to stay at a hotel that was behind the security checkpoint for SLAC, the Stanford Linear Accelerator.</p> <p> The highlight of day two was attending Nat Sakimura&#39;s presentation on his <a href=%34http://wiki.openid.net/Artifact_Binding%34>OpenID artifact binding</a> proposal, a specification JanRain will watch closely as it progresses in the future. It&#39;s a proposal for detaching the data transfer in OpenID from the protocol exchange itself, resulting in significantly less data sent through the user&#39;s web browser. This also provides opportunities for stronger data protection policies to be developed. It is a clean solution to several different issues we face today, and it allows new features for OpenID in the future as well.</p> <p> Day three was shorter than the rest, with fewer time slots for sessions, and fewer sessions distributed among those time slots. I spent most of the day talking one-on-one with various people. I was pleased to have Nat Sakimura ask for my thoughts about his proposal for artifact binding, and ask me to join the working group so I could continue contributing in the future.</p> <p> The biggest standout from the conference was the sheer size of it.

DivineCaroline&rsquo;s user interface for posting a comment to Google Buzz or Facebook using JanRain RPX Qype is Europe&rsquo;s largest user-generated local review site, with sites in 10 countries and 7 languages, and mobile apps on most major platforms. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really important for our users to be able to publish their content to as wide an audience as possible, and using RPX, we make that very easy for them. Both sign-up and sharing are now one-click experiences, and it&rsquo;s great to easily bring this to our iPhone application too,&rdquo; said Phil Chambers, CTO at Qype. &ldquo;We will roll out public publishing support for Google Buzz on May 20.&rdquo; Qype's user interface for publishing a review to up to 5 social networks, including Google Buzz, using JanRain RPX Both sites enable their users to either register or login with a third party identity such as Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Twitter and leave a comment on a post. The users are then prompted to publish comments to a social network with a single click. In addition to posting activity updates to Google Buzz, the release of the API also includes support for searching on activity feeds by latitude, longitude and radius and liking or unliking an activity. Over the next few months JanRain will be releasing features that allow websites to take advantage of the rich feature set around Google Buzz activity streams to build personalized and engaging experiences for their end users. Lastly, the Google Buzz API has resulted in the adoption of community-developed protocols, formats, and standards for sharing and consuming social content on the web, including ActivityStreams, Atom, AtomPub, JSON, OAuth, PubSubHubbub, MediaRSS, PortableContacts, and more. This is a huge win for the open standards community. _____ Vidya Shivkumar Director, Product Management JanRain",
